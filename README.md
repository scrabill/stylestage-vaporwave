# but what is vaporwave?

The Wikipedia entry for [Vaporwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave) explains it best.

> Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music, a visual art style, and an Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s... Visually, it incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos.

Wow.
